# CarSync
CarSync is a car fleet management system that utilizes MySQL for data storage. This project was a collaborative effort between me and my two colleagues during my two-month internship at Polarising. Our goal was to create a system that allowed clients to access a website or app where they could register cars, input insurance information, and make payments for tickets. The data provided by clients would then be stored in a MySQL database and managed by employees responsible for database updates.

Initially, our plan was to implement a console-based user interface (UI), but we managed to complete the project ahead of schedule. Consequently, we made the decision to expedite our development process and transition to JForms. However, since none of us had prior experience with JForms, we encountered some challenges during the integration process.

To run the project, simply execute the WelcomMenuForm class.
